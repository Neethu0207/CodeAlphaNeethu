## 🎵 Music Recommendation System

A personalized music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user preferences using Machine Learning techniques such as Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.This repository contains the implementation of a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify dataset from Kaggle. The system is built with Machine Learning techniques to suggest songs to users based on their listening history and preferences.


## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a system that recommends music tailored to a user's taste. By analyzing past listening behavior, genre preferences, and audio features of songs, the system generates smart and relevant recommendations.The Music Recommendation System aims to predict the likelihood that a user will enjoy a song. By analyzing the user's past song history and the properties of the music, the system will generate a list of recommended tracks. The model uses the Spotify dataset which contains a variety of features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, valence, and others.The primary objectives of this Music Recommendation System project are as follows:

User Personalization: To create a personalized experience for users by recommending tracks based on their individual tastes and listening habits.

Feature Utilization: To effectively use the features available in the Spotify dataset, such as acoustic properties and metadata, to inform the recommendation algorithms.

Model Accuracy: To develop a Machine Learning model that accurately predicts user preferences, aiming for high precision and recall in the recommendations.

Scalability: To ensure the system can handle a large number of users and songs without a decline in performance.

User Engagement: To increase user engagement by providing relevant song recommendations that would encourage further interaction with the service.

Algorithm Diversity: To explore and implement different recommendation algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness for this specific application.

Data Analysis: To perform comprehensive data analysis to understand user behavior and song popularity, which in turn can improve the recommendation engine.

Continuous Learning: To implement a system that learns over time, improving its recommendations as it gains more data on user preferences.

These objectives drive the development and iterative improvement of the music recommendation system. By achieving these goals, the project aims to deliver a robust and enjoyable user experience.


## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 Recommend songs based on user preferences
- 🔍 Content-Based Filtering using audio features
- 👥 Collaborative Filtering using user-item interaction matrix
- 🧠 Machine Learning models for prediction
- 📊 Data visualization and EDA on music dataset
- 💡 Scalable and modular project structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Scikit-learn for ML models
- Surprise library (for collaborative filtering)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
- Streamlit (optional) for web deployment

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains:
- User IDs
- Track IDs
- Artist Names
- Genres
- Audio features (tempo, loudness, energy, etc.)
- Ratings or play counts (for collaborative filtering)

Example Sources:
- [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/)
- [Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-dataset)

## 📈 Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand user behavior and song metadata
- Visualize correlations between features

### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- Recommend songs based on similarity of features (e.g., genre, tempo, energy)

### 3. Collaborative Filtering
- Use matrix factorization (SVD) to recommend songs based on user-song interaction history

### 4. Evaluation
- Precision@k, Recall@k
- RMSE for predicted ratings

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-system.git
cd music-recommendation-system
