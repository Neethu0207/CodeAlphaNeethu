# 🧠 Face Detection Project

This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV and Python. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to identify faces in real-time via a webcam or on static images.

## 📌 Project Overview

Face detection is a foundational task in computer vision with applications in security, photography, and social media. This project demonstrates how machine learning and computer vision techniques can be applied for accurate face detection.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 🎥
- Haar Cascade Classifiers 🧱
- Jupyter Notebook (for explanation and testing)
- Matplotlib (for image visualization)

## 🛠️ Features

- Detects human faces in images and video streams
- Works in real-time with a webcam
- Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes
- Supports grayscale image processing for performance

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git
