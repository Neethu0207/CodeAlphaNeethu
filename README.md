# 🧠 Face Detection Project

This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV and Python. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to identify faces in real-time via a webcam or on static images.

## 📌 Project Overview

Face detection is a foundational task in computer vision with applications in security, photography, and social media. This project demonstrates how machine learning and computer vision techniques can be applied for accurate face detection.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 🎥
- Haar Cascade Classifiers 🧱
- Jupyter Notebook (for explanation and testing)
- Matplotlib (for image visualization)

## 🛠️ Features

- Detects human faces in images and video streams
- Works in real-time with a webcam
- Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes
- Supports grayscale image processing for performance

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git
   cd face-detection-opencv





## 🎵 Music Recommendation System

A personalized music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user preferences using Machine Learning techniques such as Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a system that recommends music tailored to a user's taste. By analyzing past listening behavior, genre preferences, and audio features of songs, the system generates smart and relevant recommendations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 Recommend songs based on user preferences
- 🔍 Content-Based Filtering using audio features
- 👥 Collaborative Filtering using user-item interaction matrix
- 🧠 Machine Learning models for prediction
- 📊 Data visualization and EDA on music dataset
- 💡 Scalable and modular project structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Scikit-learn for ML models
- Surprise library (for collaborative filtering)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
- Streamlit (optional) for web deployment

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains:
- User IDs
- Track IDs
- Artist Names
- Genres
- Audio features (tempo, loudness, energy, etc.)
- Ratings or play counts (for collaborative filtering)

Example Sources:
- [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/)
- [Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-dataset)

## 📈 Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand user behavior and song metadata
- Visualize correlations between features

### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- Recommend songs based on similarity of features (e.g., genre, tempo, energy)

### 3. Collaborative Filtering
- Use matrix factorization (SVD) to recommend songs based on user-song interaction history

### 4. Evaluation
- Precision@k, Recall@k
- RMSE for predicted ratings

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-system.git
cd music-recommendation-system
